### Overview

### Code Description

1. **Rust source code**
Rust Initiation using cargo init

Initialize a new Rust project by running â€˜cargo init` inside the directory, it will set up a new Rust project by:

Creating a Cargo.toml file, which contains configuration data, dependencies, and other metadata about the Rust project.

Creating a src directory with a main.rs file for binary projects or lib.rs for libraries.

Here's how the toml file looks:

2. **Usage of Github Copilot**
   
    2.1 Creating main.rs. The rust file main.rs has been created with the help of copilot. The week5 mini project has the python code to perform CRUD operation using sqlite. The copilot helped me in translating 	it into rust code and performing the required action from CLI
    2.2 The dependencies and packages required for Cargo.toml was added using copilot.
    2.3 It also helped me in understanding the usage of cargo commands.
    2.4 The Makefile commands had to changes for building, tetsing, formating and liniting. The copilot again was useful with the suggestion

4. create.py
    This script is used for load and transform. A databased called 'ranking.db' with a table named 'data' is created and a csv file is loaded into that table.

4. To begin running the code after successfully building using 
      - Cargo build 
  Run the command 
      - cargo run main.rs
The ouput from this command will be :

</p>

Here we can directly input the sql command and interact with the database

5. read.py
  The queries used are :
    - SELECT "Name of University" FROM universities WHERE
      "Location" == "United States"
    - SELECT "Name of University", "No of student per staff" FROM
      universities WHERE "No of student per staff" > 40.0
    - SELECT "Name of University", "No of student per staff" FROM
        universities WHERE ("No of student per staff" < 40.0) AND ("Location" == "Canada")

6. update.py
    Updating of tuple values already present in the table.

7. delete.py
    Deletion of data present in the table. The query used is :
      DELETE FROM universities WHERE "Industry Income Score" < 90.0

8. **Optimized Rust Binary**
Included a process that generates an optimized Rust binary as a GitHub Actions artifact that can be downloaded.
